# Awesome Inclusive Language Tooling

The INI Community Workstream is soliciting demos of linters and other tools for scanning and replacing harmful language in repositories of source code, documentation, and other content, as well as tools for tracking progress of replacement efforts.

We have two primary motivations for collecting these tool demos.

First, we want to learn about and promote tools to aid open source projects and other organizations in their own inclusive language efforts. After we've collected a series of demos, we intend to write a blog post about the tools and include tools we've learned about alongside our other resources.

Second, we want to understand the needs of tool makers with regard to the word lists that their applications consume, in order to inform a specification for a machine readable word list that the INI can maintain and provide for tool makers who want to reference an "official" word list in their tools.

For the demos, we're looking to record short demonstrations of the tools in action, including basic information about intended uses, any new upcoming features, and any interesting lessons learned or challenges encountered during development.

We can record the demos during a meeting of the Community Workstream or at a separately scheduled time, hosted by one of the workstream members or leads. We expect the demos to be under ten minutes in length.

To sign up to demo your tool, either contact the WS community leads at ws-community@inclusivenaming.org via email or add a line to the table below here by opening a PR.

Inclusion in this table does not signify that the listed tools are endorsed or maintained by the the Inclusive Naming Initiative.
