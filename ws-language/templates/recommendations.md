Also not consistent with Python's use.                                                                                                                                        |

"Denylist" indicates intent, and is less active. Might be cases that "block" or "deny" works on its own (without "list").                                                                                                                        |

It is suggested that "firewall" means something functionally different than "Chinese wall."                                                                                                                           |

Recommended that we subject this term to INI's framework to assess its appropriateness. "Inactive" is a soft recommendation for now.                                                                     |
