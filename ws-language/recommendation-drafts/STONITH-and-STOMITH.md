## Use Context
In computing clusters, a failed node or machine can disrupt the entire setup.
To prevent this, failed nodes/machines are fenced off from the others and deactivated.
The term refers to the action undertaken to deactivate, power down, or otherwise disable the failed node/machine.

## Rationale for Replacement
TBD (unnecessarily violent?)
