# Inclusive Naming Initiative Biweekly Bosun Guide  

This doc is a guide to help the delegated INI member perform the role of /bosun/ for the public meeting. 
A bosun is person who organizes and conducts the meeting, borrowed from the [nautical term /boatswain/ or /bosun/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boatswain)
INI meeting attendees will pick a new one for the next meeting at the end.  

## Before / Prep for meeting 
1. Create the skeleton meeting agenda:
- copy the template on the meeting agenda 
2. Assign timeboxes. Guidance: anything not needing discussion should be 1 min each - 
examples: voting, assigning. If it's a community member topic: ask.
3. Post a call for discussion topics with draft agenda at least 3 business days with
a clear cut off to the following places as reminders:
  - inclusivenaming@googlegroups.com, 
  - #general
Ideally this would be Wednesday before the meeting and closing the agenda by 
Friday to give time for everyone to prepare.  

## Day of Meeting 

1. Join ten minutes early to make sure all audio, video, and zoom
administration (including capability to record) is right. You'll need the zoom 
host key at the very least and to record to the cloud.  
2. Make sure that you have cleared your desktop and can be prepared to present
if needed. Sometimes AV problems will require you to step in and present.
### Starting:
1. Before recording the meeting, tell the group “This is an Inclusive Naming 
Initiative meeting that will be posted publicly on YouTube, so please be mindful 
that what you say is being recorded. Please also mute if you are not speaking.” 
2. If the agenda has room, call on others to add topics and start recording.
3. Encourage attendees to do roll call on the agenda. 
#### After recording starts:
1. Hello! Welcome! [introduce yourself] This is the Inclusive Naming Initiative 
biweekly public Meeting for [date].
2. Code of Conduct reminder with instructions.
  - DM you as bosun
3. Ask for a note-taker if you don't have one and for folks to raise hands when
they have discussion points or comments.
4. Ask if there are new attendees to the meeting, and if they'd like to 
introduce themselves.
5. Discuss that we may ask for further context, docs, etc. so that we can better
understand larger issues or items. If there is a case where we don’t have
enough or not prepared, we will set up a separate meeting, bump to the mailing
list for further conversation, or invite to another meeting.
#### Mid-meeting
1. Check on zoom chat to make sure voices are heard and acknowledged there.
2. Make sure attendees who haven't had a chance to comment are given the
opportunity for each discussion topic. 
3. Adhere to timeboxes as much as possible.  
## Ending:
1. Pick the next bosun.  
2. Thank everyone for their time.
